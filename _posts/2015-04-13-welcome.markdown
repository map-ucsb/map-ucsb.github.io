[Minorities and Philosophy](http://mapforthegap.com "National MAP
site") is a graduate-student-run organization seeking to address
issues of diversity in academic philosophy, such as

- Underrepresentation of marginalized groups,
- Erasure of philosophical contributions by marginalized individuals
  both past and present,
- Department climates hostile towards marginalized individuals,
  exemplified through behaviors ranging from microaggressions to
  biased hiring to harassment.

The local UCSB chapter of MAP runs events on campus aimed at
supporting graduate and undergraduate students and educating all
members of the department about the realities of academic philosophy
for marginalized individuals.

Our chapter's inagural projects center on pedagogy.  We are currently
running a reading group on
[Pedagogy and Mental Health](/pedagogy-and-mental-health/ "Project
page") in preparation for a regional MAP conference, and we were
recently awarded—along with Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego—a
[UCHRI Working Group award](http://philosophy.ucsb.edu/2015/03/graduate-students-win-award-for-work-in-philosophy-and-inclusive-pedagogy/
"UCSB Philosphy deparment") for work on inclusive pedagogy.

As we run more events and produce more work, we will provide updates
here about lessons learned and future opportunities.
